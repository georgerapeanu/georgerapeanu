### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

## About me
I have graduated as valedictorian at BabeÈ™-Bolyai University bachelors degree in Computer Science.

## Project showcase
Some of the projects I am most proud of are:

* <a href="https://github.com/georgerapeanu/BBU-Computer-Science"> BBU-Computer-Science </a> - here you can find a good part of all my university-related work.
* <a href="https://github.com/georgerapeanu/EmbedMarkdownTool">Embed markdown tool</a> - a simple tool that allows building more complex markdown(and other type of files) files. 
* <a href="https://github.com/georgerapeanu/ImageDecomposerC">Image decomposer</a> - an app that uses a Monte Carlo approach in order to approximate images using various shapes. It also has multi-threading support.
